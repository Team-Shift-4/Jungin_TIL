# Propositional Logic

## Introduction

The rules of logic give precise meaning to mathematical statements.\
These rules are used to distinguish between valid and invalid mathematical arguments.\
Because a major goal ofthis book is to teach the reader how to understand and how to construct correct mathematical arguments, we begin our study of discrete mathematics with an introduction to logic.

In addition to its importance in understanding mathematical reasoning, logic has numerous applications in computer science.\
These rules are used in the design of computer circuits, the construction of computer programs, the verification of the correctness of programs, and in many other ways. \
Furthermore, software systems have been developed for constructing proofs automatically. We will discuss these applications of logic in the upcoming chapters.

## Propositions

Our discussion begins with an introduction to the basic building blocks of logic-propositions.\
A **proposition** is a declarative sentence (that is, a sentence that declares a fact) that is either true or false, but not both.

### Example 1

All the following declarative sentences are propositions.

1. Washington, D.C., is the capital of the United States of America.
2. Toronto is the capital of Canada.
3. 1 + 1 = 2.
4. 2 + 2 = 3.

Propositions 1 and 3 are true, whereas 2 and 4 are false.

Some sentences that are not propositions are given in Example 2.

### Example 2

Consider the following sentences.

1. What time is it?
2. Read this carefully.
3. x + 1 = 2.
4. x + y = Z.

Sentences 1 and 2 are not propositions because they are not declarative sentences.\
Sentences 3 and 4 are not propositions because they are neither true nor false. \
Note that each of sentences 3 and 4 can be turned into a proposition if we assign values to the variables.\
We will also discuss other ways to turn sentences such as these into propositions in Section 1 .3.

We use letters to denote **propositional variables** (or **statement variables**), that is, variables that represent propositions, just as letters are used to denote numerical variables.\
The conventional letters used for propositional variables are p, q, r, S, . . . . The **truth value** of a proposition is true, denoted by T, if it is a true proposition and false, denoted by F, if it is a false proposition.\
The area of logic that deals with propositions is called the **propositional calculus** or **propositional logic**. \
It was first developed systematically by the Greek philosopher Aristotle more than 2300 years ago.
